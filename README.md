My kinetic sculpture is a marble run that utilizes the stepper motor and the servo motor. The stepper motor is attached to an Archimedes screw, which rotates constantly and lifts the marble to the track.

Inside the screw is a card spock spiral, which pushes the marble against the screw's paper wall and raises it as it rotates. The marble exits the screw at the top and falls onto the track, where it races down toward a fork in the path controlled by the servo.

The servo swings back and forth periodically, blocking and unblocking the marble's path to the "win" track.  

The sculpture is controlled by the API at the following URL:
